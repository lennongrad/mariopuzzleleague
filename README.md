# Mario Puzzle League

**Mario Puzzle League** is an abstract puzzle game developed in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) based on the 1995 Super Nintendo games [*Panel de Pon/Tetris Attack*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack). The game is designed in the classic SNES aspect ratio with perfect pixel alignment to closely mimic the game, but by release will feature completely original graphics based on the *Super Mario* series circa 1995.

From the back of the box:
> The Puzzle League sensation has landed in Dinosaur Land. Help Mario compete against Bowser and other foes in a test of dexterity, with a demanding race of strategic moves and thoughtful analysis.
